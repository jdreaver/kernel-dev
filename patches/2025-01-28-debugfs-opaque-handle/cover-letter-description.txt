debugfs: Use opaque debugfs_node handle to support kernfs migration

TODO (things to cover):

- Ask if coccinelle script is okay. I purposely didn't try to cover every case in Coccinelle. I focused on the use case of a maintainer running the script if there is a merge conflict. Any advice is appreciated. I tried to do funny things to make it more terse but it just made it buggy.
  - Latter parts of coccinelle script can be manual fixups if necessary (only like 1-2 callers for each of those functions)
- This patch will make any future internal migration much easier
  - Lots more to do before we could plug in kernfs. Biggest hurdle is refactoring file ops structs
- One escape hatch to dentry was required for relay stuff. I noticed that kernfs also allows getting a kernfs_node's dentry. (One example is in blktrace.c)
