# TODO

- Get feedback on approach
- Try to make it impossible for users to access dentry. Move struct definition to some "internal.h" file
- Consider reducing casts by using helper functions to convert to/from dentry
  - Less important if users can't access dentry
- If we eventually want to use `kernfs`, we need to consider `file_operations` as well. That would be a super hard thing to migrate across all of the kernel.
  - Maybe not actually. There are lots of helper macros being used by debugfs users that will make this easier.

## Finding all usages

Steve suggested we do the opaque pointer migration in one go. I need to make sure I get _everything_ in this case:

- Automation idea: I think I can use `rg` to find all users of the debugfs API and clang-query `to` figure out the types of variables that used to be `dentry`. Then I can ask for the variable definition and edit those types, perhaps using coccinelle in the pipeline somewhere too.
- Compile with `makeallyesconfig`
- Manually grep public debugfs APIs to make sure I covered everything
- Re-check my query (and as I do this, think of other things to grep for)

  ```
  $ rg 'struct dentry \*.*(debug|dbg).*' | wc -l
  1009
  $ rg '(debug|dbg).*struct dentry \*' | wc -l
  258
  ```

  Alternatively:

  ```
  $ rg 'struct dentry \*.*(debug|dbg).*' --files-with-matches | wc -l
  662
  $ rg '(debug|dbg).*struct dentry \*' --files-with-matches | wc -l
  141
  ```

- Write a script to get filenames for the union of all of the previous search methods and ensure they are in the diff

## (Old) Incremental idea

I'm pretty sure we can't just big-bang migrate everything. There are way too many users of `struct dentry *` for debugfs nodes. Here is potentially a subset:

```
$ rg 'struct dentry \*.*(debug|dbg).*' | wc -l
1009
```

I think I should make this incremental:
- Make `struct debugfs_node { struct dentry dentry };` like I have.
- Make new functions with `node` in the name that use `debugfs_node`, like `struct dentry *debugfs_lookup(const char *name, struct dentry *parent);` -> `struct debugfs_node *debugfs_lookup_node(const char *name, struct debugfs_node *parent);`
- Incrementally migrate users
  - Add a deprecation check for the non-`node` versions in `checkpatch.pl`
- Once all users are migrated, nuke the old non-`node` functions

I think this plan is good, except I'm sad we have to pollute all the names with `node`. `debugfs_lookup` and `debugfs_create_file` are just so much cleaner than `debugfs_lookup_node` and `debugfs_create_file_node`
