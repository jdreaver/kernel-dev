I noticed this small discrepancy while writing an observability tool
that uses /proc/diskstats. I did a double take because I noticed the
extra fields in my own system's /proc/diskstats while I was reading this
doc, but _before_ I got to the descriptions for fields 16 and 17.

I think the discussion of historical formats for 2.4, 2.6, and 4.18 in
this document is confusing and not very useful. If you'd like, I'm happy
to make a patch that rewrites the intro to simplify it and remove
discussion of the historical formats.
