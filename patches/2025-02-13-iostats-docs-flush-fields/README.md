# `iostats` docs, update intro to include new flush fields

I noticed this while looking under the hood of `iostat` and reading the docs.

Branch is <https://github.com/jdreaver/linux/tree/davidreaver/iostat-doc-flush-fields/>.

```bash
../patches/2025-02-13-iostats-docs-flush-fields/format-patch.sh
```
