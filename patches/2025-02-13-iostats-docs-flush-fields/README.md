Lore link for v1: <https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/20250214013905.60526-1-me@davidreaver.com/T/#u>

I noticed this while looking under the hood of `iostat` and reading the docs.

Branch is <https://github.com/jdreaver/linux/tree/davidreaver/iostat-doc-flush-fields/>.

```bash
../patches/2025-02-13-iostats-docs-flush-fields/format-patch.sh
```
