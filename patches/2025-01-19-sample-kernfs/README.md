# Simple pseudo-filesystem sample build on top of `kernfs`

I'm working in my own `linux` tree in a branch called `davidreaver/sample-kernfs` and is located at <https://github.com/jdreaver/linux/tree/davidreaver/sample-kernfs> (diff URL: <https://github.com/jdreaver/linux/compare/master...jdreaver:linux:davidreaver/sample-kernfs>). I'm storing patches in this directory with:

```sh
cd ~/git/kernel-dev/linux
git switch davidreaver/sample-kernfs
rm -f ../patches/2025-01-19-sample-kernfs/*.patch && git format-patch master...HEAD --base=origin/master -o ../patches/2025-01-19-sample-kernfs/ --cover-letter
```
