Hey Andrew and Greg, it looks like kernel/relay is not in MAINTAINERS. I
saw previous relay patches sent to Andrew (the docs call him the
"maintainer of last resort"). This patch touches drivers that use relay,
but since it touches so many in one patch I thought that Andrew's or
Greg's trees were more appropriate. I'm new, so apologies if I have this
wrong, and please redirect me :)

Tested by compiling the affected drivers specifically and also compiling
with allmodconfig.
