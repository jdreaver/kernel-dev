Hey Andrew and Greg, it looks like kernel/relay is not in MAINTAINERS. I
saw previous relay patches sent to Andrew (the docs call him the
"maintainer of last resort"). This patch touches drivers that use relay,
but since it touches so many in one patch I thought that Andrew's or
Greg's trees were more appropriate. I'm new, so apologies if I have this
wrong, and please redirect me :)

Tested by compiling the affected drivers specifically and also compiling
with allmodconfig. I also ran a kernel with this patch in QEMU, testing
that blktrace works and that the debugfs trace files are created and
destroyed as expected:

  [shell 1] # blktrace -d /dev/sda

  [shell 2] # nproc
  4
  [shell 2] # ls /sys/kernel/debug/block/sda/trace*
  /sys/kernel/debug/block/sda/trace0  /sys/kernel/debug/block/sda/trace2
  /sys/kernel/debug/block/sda/trace1  /sys/kernel/debug/block/sda/trace3

  [shell 1] ^C
  === sda ===
    CPU  0:                   14 events,        1 KiB data
    CPU  1:                   33 events,        2 KiB data
    CPU  2:                   64 events,        4 KiB data
    CPU  3:                   29 events,        2 KiB data
    Total:                   140 events (dropped 0),        7 KiB data

  [shell 2] # ls /sys/kernel/debug/block/sda/trace*
  ls: cannot access '/sys/kernel/debug/block/sda/trace*': No such file or directory
